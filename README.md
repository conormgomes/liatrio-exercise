Made github repo.

Further setting up repo:

- Ensuring I'm using my personal account to push instead of my school account

- Adding a .gitignore

- Unlearning past misuses of github and teaching myself how to properly use and take advantage of it


Installed Node.js and began teaching myself javascript and Node specifically via YouTube videos


**4/17/24**

Turns out I had enough info from the first YouTube video I watched to do what I think I need to in js. My initial attempts worked, but were a bit janky. I was writing the current time to a json file which was then sent as a response. I realized not too long after that Express has the option to just send a json directly. Also fixed my timestamp to just use Date.now() which I'm hopeful is the correct formatting. Will find out when I get to testing.
