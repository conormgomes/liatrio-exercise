# liatrio-exercise

**4/15/24**

Made github repo.

Further setting up repo:

- Ensuring I'm using my personal account to push instead of my school account

- Adding a .gitignore

- Unlearning past misuses of github and teaching myself how to properly use and take advantage of it


Installed Node.js and began teaching myself javascript and Node specifically via YouTube videos
